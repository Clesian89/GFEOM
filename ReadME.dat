In this folder there is the full excitation with charge -e and s 1/2
of an Hub-dim. 


 
12 September:
	Almost working code within the GFEOM
 
14 September:

	Both d_occ and density makes sanse.

	However average that should be zero by definition look they are not
	We probably should take them away. We should enforce the fact that they are 0. 

	The spectral weight is calculated, the total weight sum up to 1 as expected.
	However the individual weight could be negative but this I think is due to the fact that the
	0 average by definition are not 0 in the solution
